DONE
  - basic eval
  - stubbed out math functions
  - bcd conversion function
  - tail recursion optimization
  - display tester 1 (all positions indent with separators)
  - display tester 2 (symmetric indent)
    - create display plan in vblank to allow closer spacing of cells
    - encode indent level + display type
  - tester 3 (cursor movement dynamics)
    - bracket current line
    - scrolling
    - joystick to move cursor around
    - line highlight
  - tester 4 (editor)
    - display cursor to point at current cell
    - display cursor stays in bounds of cells
    - display cursor can be at end of a list
  - virtual keyboard 1
    - button press opens keyboard
    - with open keyboard movement selects new value
    - keyboard opens on curr cell value 
    - scrolls through appropriate values
    - with press display cursor locates curr cell and replaces
    - add new cell 
    - delete cell
  - demo 1
      - start with blank program, make + 1 2
  - game modes 1
      - scratch
  - controls 1
      - moving past last line goes to menu

      - eval when button push in menu
  - demo 2
      - eval demo program + 1 2
  - menu 1

      - eval demo program + 1 99
  - display 4 
      - show numbers
      - screen layout is ... better
  - virtual keyboard 2
      - number edit
      - up to go back
      - number edit shouldn't return right away
      - number cursor is at digit being edited
  - library 1
      - beep (as continuation)
      - multiply (as continuation)
  - demo 5
      - play beep

  - code 2
    - compaction pass
  - code 2
      - compaction pass
        - don't use extra HMOV for shims
        - 75 logo color bytes removed
        - 375 bytes of logo
        - 80 bytes of symbol function lookup
        - 32 bytes of symbol / menu lookup
        - 196 unused bytes between symbol lookup and symbol data
   - reduce need for extra lookups
   - bigger symbol table? 
   - game modes 2
      - calc mode
  - bugs
    - blank program is weird
    - binary to decimal conversion is slow, blows out display
    - adding removing numbers at end messes up program (probably free memory issues)
    - beep goes too fast (need to take a beat after we eval)
    - suspect if the repl begins with an if, we don't evaluate the test properly
    - in general a const in an if hasn't been tested
    - if try to delete and recreate fib, crashes (probably free memory issue)
    - hmove bar in menu
    - music note length too short
    - sprites in display area bleed
    - unstable frame size per mode
    - evaluating empty list has random results
    - fix bug in ?
    - progn ignoring last entry
    - ? of non-funcall results in immediate return
    - loop exiting
    - progn doesn't tail recurse
    - loop can hang indefinitely, maybe recurse instead
    - reset problems
     - sometimes nuking 
     - reset in eval corrupts repl display - fixed with keydown - one of the display vars 
       - issue is: if graphics display registers are corrupt timing is thrown off
       - keydown forces rewrite of all registers
     - (maybe result of stack being trashed)
     - (f 1) (def (f a) (if (beep a 5) (f (+ a 1))))
  - menu 3
      - allow cyclical switching
      - separate lines for function vs mode
