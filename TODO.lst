DONE
  - basic eval
  - stubbed out math functions
  - bcd conversion function
  - tail recursion optimization
  - display tester 1 (all positions indent with separators)
  - display tester 2 (symmetric indent)
    - create display plan in vblank to allow closer spacing of cells
    - encode indent level + display type
  - tester 3 (cursor movement dynamics)
    - bracket current line
    - scrolling
    - joystick to move cursor around
    - line highlight
  - tester 4 (editor)
    - display cursor to point at current cell
    - display cursor stays in bounds of cells
    - display cursor can be at end of a list
  - virtual keyboard 1
    - button press opens keyboard
    - with open keyboard movement selects new value
    - keyboard opens on curr cell value 
    - scrolls through appropriate values
    - with press display cursor locates curr cell and replaces
    - add new cell 
    - delete cell
  - demo 1
      - start with blank program, make + 1 2
  - game modes 1
      - scratch
  - controls 1
      - moving past last line goes to menu
      - moving above first line goes to menu
      - eval when button push in menu
  - demo 2
      - eval demo program + 1 2
  - menu 1
      - function menu displayed on screen
  - menu 2
      - function assignment when push in menu
  - demo 3
      - fib program
      - eval demo program + 1 99
  - bugs
      - blank program is weird
      - binary to decimal conversion is slow, blows out display
      - adding removing numbers at end messes up program (probably free memory issues)
      - beep goes too fast (need to take a beat after we eval)
      - suspect if the repl begins with an if, we don't evaluate the test properly
      - in general a const in an if hasn't been tested
      - if try to delete and recreate fib, crashes (probably free memory issue)
  - display 4 
      - show numbers
      - screen layout is ... better
  - virtual keyboard 2
      - number edit
      - up to go back
      - number edit shouldn't return right away
      - number cursor is at digit being edited
  - library 1
      - beep (as continuation)
      - multiply (as continuation)
  - demo 5
      - play beep
BUGS
  - code
    - complex program takes too long to analyze in vblank
BETA
