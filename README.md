# LISP Programming 
LISP Programming is a Lisp interpreter that runs on the Atari 2600, a second generation home video game console. 

Play the game at [github.io](https://dchristianson.github.io/vcs-lisp/)!

This is an Atari 2600 game from an alternate reality...

- where a [computer language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) from [1960](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/367177.367199) 
- has been hastily crammed onto a VCS ROM cartridge circa 1977
- so you can learn to program from a [textbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) first published in 1984
