This is an Atari 2600 game from an alternate reality...

- where a [computer language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) from 1960 
- has been hastily crammed onto a VCS ROM cartridge in 1977
- so you can learn to program from a [textbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) first published in 1984
